# CheckmateHim On - Chain Arena

—— The Ultimate Fusion of Blockchain and Chess Strategy\
CheckmateHim is the world’s first blockchain - native competitive platform centered around Chinese Chess, combining the immutability of blockchain with the thrill of strategic gameplay. Every move is recorded on - chain, and victories translate directly into digital assets (NFT medals, reputation tokens), with smart contracts ensuring transparent adjudication.

## Key Features

- ✅ On - Chain Fairness: Victories are automatically determined by Solidity smart contracts. Zero - knowledge proofs verify game legitimacy, eliminating human bias.
- ✅ Dynamic NFT Medals: Each "checkmate" mint an exclusive NFT inscribed with opponent address, game hash, and evolutionary design (Bronze → King). NFTs are fractionalizable for liquidity.
- ✅ Multi - Chain Ecosystem: Built on Polygon (low - cost transactions) + Ethereum (asset settlement), with future Solana integration (high performance). Cross - chain reputation system ("Conquest Index") tracks global rankings.
- ✅ Hybrid Tech Stack:\
   ▸ Frontend: Deno Fresh (TypeScript) for dynamic chessboard UI + WebSocket
  real - time sync.\
   ▸ Smart Contracts: Solidity for Chinese Chess rules, NFT minting, and asset
  management.\
   ▸ Backend (Roadmap): Go for high - concurrency matchmaking, Python for AI training (Leela Chess Zero) and analytics.

## Vision

Create a "Chess Metaverse on Blockchain," where every strategy session builds digital wealth and every NFT medal is a permanent testament to skill. Starting with Chinese Chess, expand to Go, Chess, and more, evolving into a DAO - governed global strategy hub.

### MVP Phase: Launch Deno Fresh chessboard + Solidity Chinese Chess contract, supporting real - time battles and NFT medal minting
