# CheckmateHim On-Chain Arena Design Document

## Project Overview

CheckmateHim is an on-chain arena centered around "chess strategy" where players aim to "checkmate" opponents and seize their on-chain assets. Inspired by the ultimate goal of chess - "Checkmate", combined with the irreversibility of blockchain, every chess move is transformed into an on-chain atomic operation,and smart contracts ensure transparent adjudication of wins and losses. Players can accumulate reputation tokens and NFT medals by defeating opponents, building a decentralized gaming empire.

## Technical Stack Design

### Frontend (React + On-Chain Interaction)

- Deno Fresh + TypeScript: Dynamic chessboard visualization supporting classic
  chess games (chess, Go) and custom rule modes.
- Ethers.js/Wagmi: Seamless integration with multi-chain wallets
  (MetaMask/Phantom), real-time display of on-chain assets (NFT medals, token
  balances).
- Socket.IO: Real-time battle state synchronization and chat functionality to
  enhance player interaction.

### Smart Contract Layer (Solidity + Rust)

#### Solidity (EVM Chain)

- Core Contracts: Chess game rule engine, win/loss determination logic, token
  staking and distribution.
- NFT Contracts: Dynamically generate "Checkmate Medals NFT" recording the
  history of defeating opponents (metadata includes opponent address, game
  hash).

#### Rust (Non-EVM Chains like Solana)

- High-performance on-chain programs: Suitable for complex chess game state
  calculations (like Go), reducing Gas consumption.

### Backend Services (Go + Python)

#### Go

- Real-time Battle Server: Based on Goroutine to handle high-concurrency battle
  matching and state pushing.
- Off-chain Calculation Engine: Pre-calculate complex chess game branches (like
  Go's Ko rule determination), reducing on-chain load.

#### Python

- AI Training Module: Integrates open-source engines like Leela Chess Zero to
  provide AI opponents with difficulty levels.
- Data Analysis Dashboard: Statistics on player win rates, common strategies,
  and generates on-chain reputation maps.

## Blockchain Network

- Main Chain: Polygon (low-cost high-frequency transactions) + Ethereum (asset
  settlement layer).
- Storage:
  - IPFS: Stores game replay data and NFT dynamic metadata (such as 3D medal
    models).
  - Ceramic Network: Binds decentralized identity (DID) to player reputation
    system.

## Core Feature Highlights

### On-Chain Adjudication Mechanism (Immutable Checkmate)

Win/loss determination is entirely executed by smart contracts, using
zero-knowledge proofs (like zk-SNARKs) to verify the legality of complex chess
game branches, preventing human manipulation.

### Dynamic NFT Medal System

- After each "checkmate" of an opponent, a unique NFT medal is generated, with
  its appearance evolving based on the opponent's level and game moves (such as
  Bronze → King Medal).
- NFTs can be decomposed into token fragments for exchanging on-chain resources
  or unlocking special chessboard skins.

### Cross-Chain Reputation Battlefield

Supports multi-chain account binding (such as Ethereum +
Solana),汇总玩家在不同链的胜率汇总为全局“征服指数”,排名高者可发起“帝国战争”争夺链上治理权。

## Application Scenarios

- On-Chain Tournaments: Players stake tokens to participate in elimination
  tournaments, with the final "checkmate" winner claiming the prize pool.
- DAO Governance: High-reputation players vote on new chess rules or community
  treasury allocations.
- NFT Derivative Ecosystem: Medal NFTs can be used as collateral for other DeFi
  protocols or to unlock on-chain game privileges.

## Development Priority Recommendations

### MVP Stage

- Deno Fresh base board + Solidity chess contract + Go matching service.

### Expansion Stage

- Integrate Python AI module + multi-chain compatibility (such as Solana Go
  contract).

### Ecosystem Stage

- Cross-chain reputation system + NFT medal market + Governance DAO.

#### Design Philosophy

This design deeply integrates the essence of chess strategy with the
immutability of blockchain, achieving high availability and scalability through
a hybrid technology stack while maintaining strong competitiveness and asset
potential.
